Assignment 6\
\
The purpose of this assignment was to introduce us to ListView and RecyclerView, 2 ways to display data in a list form. ListView and RecyclerView both use the adapter design pattern, which is used to help two incompatible interfaces work together. This lab also introduced us to ViewPager, which is a useful tool that allows users to swipe left and right between fragments. For this lab, the default view was the ListView, but when the user swiped right, the active fragment was a RecyclerView. One last concept covered in this lab was the use of DialogFragments, which were used to display a more in-depth description of list items when they were clicked via popup.}
