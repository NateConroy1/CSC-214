--------- Description ---------\
For project 3 I created an event sharing app called GigFinder. The target audience for the app is local musicians looking to connect with other musicians and venues to organize shows. The app includes an event feed which lists all events, as well as all musicians, and venues in their own tabs. The event and venue pages utilize the Google Maps API to pinpoint the exact location of the events. Artists viewing event pages can click "join event" to sign up for the show, after which they will be included in the lineup as seen on the event page, as well as their own band page which includes a recycler view fragment of upcoming shows. Venue pages also include a recycler view listing their upcoming events.\
\
I used multiple SQLite databases for this project. One for login information, one for all artists, one for all events, one for all venues, and one for all appearances (relationship between bands and events).\
\
Advanced Features:\
- 
\f2 \cf4 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec4 The ability to use the camera to take and save photographs (band and venue pages)\
- Playing sounds with SoundPool (after logging in/ signing up a sound is played as user is brought to the event feed)\
- Playing longer sounds or video with MediaPlayer (full sample music on band pages)\
- Network connectivity (users can download pictures from the internet for their pages)\
- Google Play services (used Maps for event and venue pages)
